# Problem and Context

## 1.1 Background
Worldbuilding is the act of creating fictional settings. It is most often used by writers, DMs, game makers and artists to ground the stories they create, but a lot of other projects can benefit from well crafted settings and some people (like me) just practice worldbuilding in itself for fun. 
But worldbuilding is in itself an aglomeration of many other, more specific practices like conlanging (creating languages), neography (creating writing systems) or mapmaking (creating fictional maps) and many more.
One pretty well known tricks that can be used to impart complexity, richess and a sens of belivablitly to any worldbuilding project is to make it's history. Instead of building the thing only at the state that matters to you, you create it at an arbitrary point in the past and artificially simulate it's evolution up until the point that interests you. This process is way more time consuming but also more complicated as you have to understand how things like languages, alphabets, ecosystems or geology evolve over time. 
But for some worldbuilders this extra effort is worth it.
For simulating the evolution of a lot of things, paper, motivation and a great amount of knowledge is enough. But when we talk about the evolution of the geography of a planet, it get's way more complicated as the finaly product is basically a small film of continents moving on a sphere (anybody that can make that with paper get's my undying respect).

Making geological history of maps is still, even in the worldbuilding hobby, a pretty niche subject, despite the fact that geography is probably one of the highest building block of any worldbuilding projects.

## 1.2 The Gap in Existing Tools
The main reason, in my opinion, that geological histories are sadly not as common in the worldbuilding community is because there curently is a gap in the existing available tools to do so :

- **Fantasy map tools** (World Anvil, Wonderdraft, Inkarnate):
   These tools are mostly made for artistic design and story building. They can be very usefull to anotate maps or follow the progression in a story but they provide very few ways to animate the map, draw it directly on a sphere and absolutely no way to manipulate the geography of the map like real techtonic plates.
- **Scientific software** (GPlates):
   This is a professional-level application for real plate tectonics. It is extremely powerful but geared toward Earth’s data and workflows. It might be too technical for most worldbuilders and it is not designed to handle fictional mapmaking. Using it in this way has its own quirks.

I feel like there is a real need and a real opportunity for a tool geared towards fictional mapmaking that helps worldbuilder make scientifically grounded geographic histories without having to deal with the quirks and complexity of current scientific software and therefore help them make their setting more rich and more belivable.
This is this objective that this project is going to pursue.

## 1.3 Project Overview
Clia (from the contraction of *Clymene* and *Lapetus*, the parents of the titan Atlas) will be a web application that allows users that are not familiar with advanced scientific tooling to easily make geological histories of fictional maps.

The **lack of a specialized tool** for **fictional geologic history animation** presents an opportunity to:
- **Simplify** advanced scientific tools (like GPlates) into a **streamlined** web app suited for non-experts.  
- Provide an **educational bridge** between fantasy creation and real science, helping worldbduilders **enriching** their fictional settings
- Explore new and exciting technologies to solve technical challenges, be it in methematics and geometry or in user interaction.

# Identification of Major Agents

## 2.1 Overview of main agents
1. **Users** :
      **Worldbuilders**:
         Worldbuilders are simply people that want to create worlds, for any reason. They are the main target for this tool and while the worldbuilding community is quite large, making geological history is still a niche topic. This is why this project has to cater to both the casual worldbuilder that want to try their hand at geologic histories and the hardcore user who want to explore alternatives to GPlates.
      **Educators**:
         While this application is mainly targetted at worldbuilders, the opportunity of having an easy to use tool to represent techtonic interaction can be really usefull for anybody wanting to teach the basics of techtonic principles.
2. **Worldbuilding Pasta**:
   Worldbuilding Pasta is the name of a blog focused on scientifically acurate worldbuilding. This blog is by far the best ressource on the use of GPlates as a tool for fantasy geological history making [Making an apple pie from scratch V](https://worldbuildingpasta.blogspot.com/2020/06/an-apple-pie-from-scratch-part-v.html). The writer of the blog has been contacted and has expressed interest in the project but is currently waiting for the project to be better defined in order to decide if they want to involve themselves in the project. Their input on this project could be an amazing asset and they will be recontacted as the project develop in order to keep them informed.
3. **Artifexian**:
   Artifexian is a worldbuilding youtuber that has made a video serie based on Worldbuilding Pasta's blog. They have been contacted a year ago when this project was in its infancy and they expressed interest in it. I have try to recontact him to no avail but I will try to do so again as the project develops. The experience of Artifexian on worldbuilding could be really helpfull and this project could possibly also benefit from the exposure to his community.
4. **Me / Project Owner**  
   Since I have failed to convince the interested parties in taking the role of clients for this project, this role will have to be filled by myself for the time beeing. I nonetheless consider myself to be a worldbuilder and this project is one that is truely near and dear to my heart and I am not unhappy to keep ownership over it. Furthermore, the real client, in the end, is the worldbuilding community.

## 2.2 Potential Clients and Their Roles
| **Agent**  | **Background** | **Interest & Status** | **Role** |
|:--------------|:----------------------|:------------|---|
| **Artifexian**   | Produces worldbuilding, cartography, and conlang videos on Youtube | Showed interest in the project | None currently but might act as an expert or help expose the project to a wider audience|
| **WorldbuildingPasta**      | Blogger focused on advanced worldbuilding and specialist in the use of GPlates for fictional geologic history | Enthusiastic but wants more details before involving themselves more in the project.| None currently but might act as an expert once the project becomes more precise |
| **Me**| Student at Ephec with an interest in web developement| Amateur worldbuilder | current developer and owner of the project, will act as main client for the time beeing |
| **The worldbuilding community** (target users)| Anybody that has interest in worldbuilding | the few contacts I had with members of the community were positive, The project will have to be in a more advanced state before expositing it to the broader community | the project purpose is to be shared and used by as many people as possible, but setting ways of involving the community in the feedback process (discord server) is prematured |

## 2.3 Broader User Community (Future End Users)
- **Worldbuilding Enthusiasts** (writers, RPG GMs)  
- **Educators / Students** learning plate tectonics.  
- **Indie Game Developers** needing realistic planet data.

# Position of the Solution

## 5.1 Existing Solutions: Strengths, Weaknesses, and Gaps

Use this **comparison table** for a quick overview:

| **Tool**           | **Focus**       | **Strengths**                                                    | **Weaknesses**                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **GPlates**        | Scientific, Earth-based plate reconstructions | - Accurate for real Earth<br>- Powerful advanced features        | - Complex UI<br>- Steep learning curve<br>- Earth-centric<br>- Not art-oriented                                         |
| **Artistic Tools** (Wonderdraft, Inkarnate) | Fantasy map drawing | - Very easy to use<br>- Beautiful output, many assets           | - No geophysical realism<br>- 2D-only<br>- No plate animation                                                           |
| **Blender**        | 3D modeling & animation                        | - Extremely flexible<br>- Professional rendering                 | - No native tectonic logic<br>- High learning curve<br>- Manual rigging for plate motions                               |

## 5.2 Why a New Solution?
- **GPlates** is scientific but too specialized for imaginary worlds.  
- **Artistic Tools** are visually appealing but lack tectonic realism.  
- **Blender** can do anything in 3D but lacks built-in geologic processes.

A **hybrid approach** is needed: an intuitive “draw-and-animate” tool with core geoscience logic.

## 5.3 Advantages of Developing a Dedicated New Tool
1. **User-Centric Interface** (simple “draw & move” approach).  
2. **Focus on Fictional Workflows** (imagined tectonic histories, quick plate splits).  
3. **Dynamic Evolution** (animate entire planet histories).  
4. **Web-Based Integration** (Django, HTMX, Rust→WASM).  
5. **Community Involvement** (lower barrier than GPlates for hobbyists).

## 5.4 Conclusion: The Relevance of a New Solution
A **custom** application merges **intuitive map creation** with **authentic tectonic logic**, bridging the gap between specialized scientific software and purely artistic tools. It’s more than a novelty—serving as a platform for **learning**, **experimentation**, and **collaboration** in fictional geoscience.

# Technical Analysis

## 6.0 Key Challenges and objectives
- Balancing **Accessibility** and **Scientific accuracy** : This project should be available and usable by the largest number of worldbuilder while still beeing a real help to making scientifically robust geologic history. Things like the UI and the workflow should not hinder the accuracy of the tool while still having a small learning curve and encouraging an iterative process and experimentation.
- Balancing **Performance** and **Complexity** : The hardware of the user should not be a roadblock to them using the service, it should feel fast in order to not stop the creative process. At the same time, things like manipulation and colision checks of polygons on a sphere can be complexe and computationally heavy. Solutions have to be found in order to manage those two aspects of the project.
- Focusing on what is important : The premice of this project is quite complexe, therefore an effort should be made in order to avoid unnecessary complexity where it is possible.

## 6.1 High-Level Architecture Overview
We need a browser-based solution that:
1. **Renders a 3D globe** (Three.js) for interactive plate drawing.  
2. **Computes geometry** in Rust→WASM for performance.  
3. **Stores data** in Django, employing HTMX for partial page updates.  
4. **Scales** with agile increments.

## 6.2 Back-End Layer (Django + HTMX)
A Python-based framework for robust data handling and quick partial updates:
- **Django**: Admin, ORM, security.  
- **HTMX**: Enables partial HTML updates with minimal JavaScript overhead.

## 6.3 3D Rendering & Front-End Visualization (Three.js)
- **Three.js** for an interactive 3D globe.  
- Large community, flexible scene management, easy to integrate with HTML/JS.

## 6.4 High-Performance Geometry: Rust → WebAssembly
- **WebAssembly** for near-native performance in numeric tasks.  
- **Rust** ensures memory safety and strong tooling.  
- Handles polygon splitting, Euler rotations, collisions, etc.

## 6.5 Supporting Tools & Methodologies
- **Database & ORM**: Likely PostgreSQL for multi-user or advanced queries.  
- **Synchronous Django** acceptable for a single-user or small group.  
- **Security**: Django’s built-in session/auth + standard web best practices.

## 6.6 Comparison of Final Stack vs. Potential Alternatives

| **Layer**         | **Chosen**                         | **Alternatives**                            | **Reason**                                                 |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Back End          | Django + HTMX                      | Flask, FastAPI, Node.js                     | Built-in admin, robust security, partial updates w/ HTMX.  |
| Front End         | Three.js + minimal JS + HTMX        | React/Vue SPAs, Babylon.js, CesiumJS        | Straightforward 3D rendering, no heavy SPA needed.         |
| Geometry          | Rust → WASM                        | C/C++ → WASM, AssemblyScript, Go → WASM     | Safe concurrency, performance, mature Rust→JS ecosystem.   |
| 3D Visualization  | Three.js                           | Babylon.js, raw WebGL, other 3D engines     | Large community, flexible, examples for custom geometry.   |

## 6.7 Justification of Each Final Choice
1. **Django + HTMX**: Quick to set up, proven reliability, partial updates.  
2. **Rust → WASM**: Safe, high-performance math for plate-tectonic logic.  
3. **Three.js**: Well-documented 3D library for a custom globe approach.  

## 6.8 Potential Limitations & Future Enhancements
- **Large Data Sets**: Could require LOD strategies.  
- **Collaboration**: Real-time might need Django Channels or websockets.  
- **WebGPU**: Future improvement for massive polygons or advanced rendering.

# Validation Strategy
1. **User Types**: Validate with beginner worldbuilders vs. advanced tectonics enthusiasts.  
2. **Precision & Relevance**: Ensure plausible geophysics but not necessarily at the highest geoscientific detail.  
3. **Complexity**: Focus on correct polygon splitting/animation first, advanced processes next.  
4. **Priority**: MVP core (draw polygons, define plates, animate them), then secondary features (flowlines, orogenies).

# Security & GDPR
- **User Data**: Only minimal user info (e.g., logins) plus project data (polygons, timestamps).  
- **Protection**: Django’s default CSRF, session security, HTTPS.  
- **GDPR Considerations**: If storing personal data, provide user consent forms, data deletion on request, and relevant disclaimers.
